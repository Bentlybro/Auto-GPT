# AutoGPT docs

Welcome to AutoGPT. Please follow the [Installation](/setup/) guide to get started.

!!! note
    It is recommended to use a virtual machine/container (docker) for tasks that require high security measures to prevent any potential harm to the main computer's system and data. If you are considering to use AutoGPT outside a virtualized/containerized environment, you are *strongly* advised to use a separate user account just for running AutoGPT. This is even more important if you are going to allow AutoGPT to write/execute scripts and run shell commands!

It is for these reasons that executing python scripts is explicitly disabled when running outside a container environment.
